            <h1>Isometric Structures!</h1>
            <p>Sometimes I'll draw some isomentric structures to relax, it's really nice to put these peaceful little worlds together. I like to think of stories for the people that live in these isolated places, maybe one day I'll compile the good bits into a proper setting or somethin' but for now, they are just pictures.</p>

            <h1>Sunset Inn</h1>
            <p>This is the first one I properly finished, an inn perched up somewhere in the sky. The lighting rod implies a stormy weather but it is too peaceful here to use such a thing, it probably wouldn't work even if we tried!</p>

            <h1>Water Tower</h1>
            <p>A reservoir built by an industrious shopkeep, selling premium <a class="i">Mesospheric Dew!</a> to an implied population somewhere below the clouds. A light ship sits in wait for the shopkeeps errands for whenever they roll out of bed in these weeks-long mornings.</p>

            <h1>Towering Housing</h1>
            <p>The first drawing with a person in the frame, this is also the busiest one. The pillar of crates and lights juts out of the clouds at a funny angle, suspended by stonework the size of dinner tables, looking haphazardly planned and worn. As close to a city center as this series has.</p>

            <h1>Abandoned Depot</h1>
            <p>No one lives here anymore, maybe no one ever did. This was a supply depot, a crossroads with a bed, few called this place home even on its busy days. But no one lives here now, aside from perhaps a crow or rabbit.</p>
